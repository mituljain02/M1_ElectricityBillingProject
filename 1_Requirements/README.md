**#INTRODUCTION:** The Electricity Cost Calculator project is an application-based micro project that predicts the following month's electricity bill based on the appliances or loads used. Visual studio code was used to write the code for this project. This project employs a multi-file and multi-platform strategy (Linux and Windows).


- power rating of all loads
- total load calculation
- unit consumed per day
- units consumed per month

In addition, high-end electricity bill calculators generally include:

- Calculating electricity bills in urban locations
- Calculating electricity bills in rural locations
- Billing depending on the number of units used



**SWOT analysis:**

**Strengths:** Creative, User-friendly.

**Weakness**: Cost of calculator is directly proportional to addition done in feature of the calculator.

**Opportunities**: We allÂ know that we do most of our estimates with a pen and paper. As a result, the youth are always drawn to the tech-based sector.

**Threats**: In today's rapidly evolving world, slow innovation development is always a threat to the industry.



**4W's and 1'H**

**What:**  Electricity billing calculator**     

**Where:** Almost Everywhere like School, domestic, industries, Technology.

**When:** Need for calculation.

**Who:** Intergration of all the w's

**How:** Estimates the amount of loads provided by the user and returns the result.
